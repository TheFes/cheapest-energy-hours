# EXAMPLE: TURN A DEVICE ON AT THE LOWEST PRICE WHILE YOU ARE SLEEPING

In the example below a dishwasher is used, but this can be any appliance.

## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Every time before going to bed, the dishwasher is turned on. But it could be that later during the night, the prices are lower. Luckily it is a smart dishwasher which can be turned on remotely, and is integrated in Home Assistant. The program which is always used takes 2.5 hours, and the start time should be after 22:00 when the dishwasher is alreadye closed, or when the door is closed after 22:00. It should be finished at 8:00 in the morning.

## COMPLICATING FACTORS
The fact that the start time can be either before or after midnight makes this problem a bit tricky. If the cheapest block of 2.5 hours starts at 23:00, it should finish at 1:30. However, after midnight the data will be different, as there is no data of yesterday anymore. Furthermore, if you use `start='22:00', end='08:00', include_tomorrow=true` this will be the eveninng of day 2 after midnight, and the macro will return an error because there is no data of the next day available yet, and therefor there are only 2 hours of data in the selection. With some templates you could work around that issue, but then again a block of 3.5 hours will be selected which can be eg 4:00 - 6:30, which potentitally can make the dishwasher run the program twice.

## BASIC SOLUTION
If the data would not span the night `mode='is_now'` could be used, but that's not possible here because of the factors described above. In this case it's best to use a trigger based template sensor which will trigger before your stat time (with some fallbacks if HA down at that moment). You can then turn on the dishwasher when the current time matches that sensor.

### REQUIRED 
* A device which can be turned on by Home Assistant
* A sensor indiacting it's ready to turn on (door is closed)

```yaml
# template sensor
template:
  - trigger:
      -  platform: time
         at:
           - '19:30'
           - '20:30'
           - '21:30'
    sensor:
      - unique_id: f8853830-bf81-46d4-85a9-379c25c37c23
        name: Dishwasher Start Time
        device_class: timestamp
        state: >
          {%- set sensor = 'sensor.energy_prices' -%}
          {% from "cheapest_energy_hours.jinja" import cheapest_energy_hours %}
          {{ cheapest_energy_hours(sensor=sensor, hours=2.5, start='22:00', end='08:00', include_tomorrow=true) }}

# automation
automation:
  - id: 3f61bd8e-81b8-4d62-8d5d-96d8596e29b1
    alias: Start Dishwasher During Night
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: sensor.dishwasher_start_time
    condition:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.dishwasher_door
        state: "off"
    action:
      - service: swith.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.start_dishwasher
```

## ADVANCED SOLUTION
If the dishwasher also has a binary sensor indicating that remote start is activated, you can use that as well to make sure you don't miss the trigger if eg the lowest price is at 22:00 and you are having a party which ends late. And maybe it also has a binary sensor indicating the door is closes, so it doesn't trigger the automation while the door is still open.
You can use both in the template sensor to make sure it updates the trigger time accordingly. If the door is not open, or the remote functionality is not active, the template sensor will be `unavailable` so the automation will not trigger then.

### REQUIRED 
* A device which can be turned on by Home Assistant
* A sensor indicating it can be started remotely
* A sensor indiacting it's ready to turn on (door is closed)

```yaml
# template sensor
template:
  - trigger:
      -  platform: time
         at:
           - '19:30'
           - '20:30'
           - '21:30'
      - platform: state
        entity_id:
          - binary_sensor.dishwasher_door
          - binary_sensor.dishwasher_remote_active
    sensor:
      - unique_id: f8853830-bf81-46d4-85a9-379c25c37c23
        name: Dishwasher Start Time
        device_class: timestamp
        state: >
          {%- set sensor = 'sensor.energy_prices' -%}
          {% from "cheapest_energy_hours.jinja" import cheapest_energy_hours %}
          {{ cheapest_energy_hours(sensor=sensor, hours=2.5, start='22:00', end='08:00', look_ahead=true, include_tomorrow=true) }}
        availability: "{{ is_state('binary_sensor.dishwasher_door', 'on') and is_state('binary_sensor.dishwasher_remote_active', 'on')  }}"

# automation
# the door sensor is covered in the sensor now, no need to check on it in the automation
automation:
  - id: 3f61bd8e-81b8-4d62-8d5d-96d8596e29b1
    alias: Start Dishwasher During Night
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: sensor.dishwasher_start_time
    action:
      - service: swith.turn_on
        target:
```
